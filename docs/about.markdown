<h1>
Hi, I'm Matt!
</h1>
![Me kicking it](/assets/about-section-headshot.jpg)
tl;dr: I'm a husband, traveler, reader, software engineer & digital minimalist.
This site includes my stories and projects.

I was born and raised in the Chicagoland area and I'm still here today.
I'm a software engineer by trade and have worked in various industries, including
financial technology/trading, web3.0 and industry-agnostic consulting.

Some of the languages I've used in a professional setting:
* C++ (14/17)
* Python3
* Typescript
* Javascript

& I love to learn new ones!

While some may say that I have a lack of specialization, I take pride in my breadth of languages.
Learning new programming languages is fun for me and gives me a broader perspective on the "right
tool for the job". I'm not going to deploy a web server in C++, and I'm not going to write a low-latency
trading algorithm in Java. I will use Python3 for just about anythin though ;)
