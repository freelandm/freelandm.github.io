> "If you seek tranquillity, do less." Or (more accurately) do what's essential - what the _logos_ of a social being requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better. Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you'll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, "Is this necessary?" But we need to eliminate the unnecessary assumptions as well. To eliminiate the unnecessary actions that follow.

- Marcus Aurelius, _Meditations_
